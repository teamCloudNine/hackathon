## Summary

A simple Spring Boot Java Rest service that writes to a single DynamoDb table to store the state related to the beneficiary collaboration service.

The state has been implemented using a nosql single table model. Please refer to the model described [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/creating-a-single-table-design-with-amazon-dynamodb).
